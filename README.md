# obiblio-base
A simple installation of OpenBiblio with a few basic customizations

##Background
In Summer 2015, Lynne Jenne began working with the LBCC Library to identify a simple, easy-to-use library system that supports barcode copy cataloging and circulation tasks.  It also has to be used without intervention from anybody other than the library users.

There are a number of apps and web services that would allow this.  We evaluated a number of these, but the large size of the ELA library placed it out of the free usage tier.  A subscription fee is not feasible for the ELA library at this time.

I had previously used Openbiblio for the Library at [Tap In Leadership Academy](http://wiki.tapinacademy.org/index.php?title=Category:Library) in Champaign, Illinois.  This experience gave me some familiarity with its installation process and community.  It is much simpler to use and administer than the Evergreen system used by the LBCC library.  I felt confident recommending this piece of software for use in the ELA library.

##Modifications to a stock OpenBiblio Installation
Openbiblio 0.7.2 does not have all the features required by the ELA library, which meant that I needed to incorporate some customizations built by myself and others in the OpenBiblio community.

The library needs to retrieve book data via ISBN to save time during the cataloging process.  Fred LaPlante offers a very nice [lookup2](http://sourceforge.net/p/obiblio/patches/65/) patch that allows us to do this.  While by default, it uses the Library of Congress SRU server to collect data, we found that the CUNY SRU server included more of the books that are included in the ELA library.  It is worth noting that LC and CUNY use different schemata, and the [lookup patch only allows the use of one schema](https://bitbucket.org/mstetson/obiblio-10-wip/issues/23/lookup-must-allow-hosts-to-use-other-sru) at a time.  This makes switching between CUNY records and LC records a bit of a pain.

To make the lookup2 patch a bit more user-friendly, I also applied [Wolfram Sang's patch](http://sourceforge.net/p/obiblio/patches/87/) that simplifies the lookup2 interface.

I had previously developed a [very small patch](https://github.com/tapinacademy/obiblio-covers) to include a cover image in catalog images.  I added this to help with identifying desired books.

Finally, [xelite25](https://github.com/xelite25), a work study student at LBCC, contributed some helpful documentation.  This documentation was almost entirely missing from the original.


##How to install this on a Linux server

The only file missing from this repository is (https://bitbucket.org/mstetson/obiblio/src/babf99e9469d7f0be0eaff11cbadf92badb0a6f3/database_constants.php)[database_constants.php].  The only additional file is the database file (https://github.com/sandbergja/obiblio-base/blob/master/obiblio-base.sql)[obiblio-base.sql].

To install obiblio-base on a server:
1. Type `git clone https://github.com/sandbergja/obiblio-base.git` on the command line.

2. `cd obiblio-base`

3. Open mysql on the command line.

4. Type `CREATE DATABASE db_name` where db_name is the name you'd like to call your database.

5. Type `SOURCE obiblio-base.sql`

6. Close mysql by pressing `^D`

7. Create a database_constants.php file

I also created a cron job so that all materials that are
"on the shelving cart" are moved back to the shelves automatically at
midnight daily.  This way, the ELA  library won't have any items languishing on the
shelving cart after being checked in.  I accomplished this with the following one-liner:  `mysql -u username -ppassword -hhostname -e 'UPDATE biblio_copy SET status_cd="in" WHERE status_cd = "crt"' db_name`

##Further steps in this project
Version 1.0 of openbiblio is available as a beta.  While it looks very nice, it still has some issues that I'd like to see resolved before moving to the new version.

However, OpenBiblio 0.7.2 has not seen any major updates for over a year.  since I am running the ELA catalog with PHP 5.6, a lot of its code relies on deprecated functions, and I am having to suppress more warnings than I would like.  I am planning to keep an eye on the list of unresolved issues and possibly upgrade OpenBiblio during Summer 2016.
